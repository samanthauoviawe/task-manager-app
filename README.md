🧠 Thought Process
This task manager was built with simplicity and performance in mind. I chose Vite for its fast development experience and React for dynamic UI updates. CSS was written from scratch to retain full control over responsive behavior and accessibility. The app is fully functional offline with data saved in the browser.
